configuration of Azure Logic Apps

●	Automate tasks and business processes

●	Example use-cases:

○	Process and route orders across on-premises and cloud systems

○	Send email notifications with Office 365 when events happen in various systems, apps and services

○	Move uploaded files from an SFTP or FTP server to Azure storage

○	Monitor social media for a specific sentiment




Here's a step-by-step guide to configure Azure Logic Apps for automating tasks and business processes, along with example use-cases:

1. **Create a Logic App**: 
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal and click on "Create a resource".
   - Search for "Logic App" and select it.
   - Click "Create" and provide the necessary details such as name, subscription, resource group, and location.

2. **Choose a Trigger**: 
   - Once the Logic App is created, click on it to open the Logic App Designer.
   - Choose a trigger that initiates the workflow. For example:
     - For processing and routing orders, you might use an "HTTP request" trigger or a "When a HTTP request is received" trigger.
     - For sending email notifications with Office 365, you might use the "Office 365 Outlook" connector and choose a trigger like "When a new email arrives".
     - For moving files from an SFTP or FTP server to Azure storage, you might use the "When a file is added or modified (properties only)" trigger under the "FTP" or "SFTP" connector.

3. **Configure Trigger**: 
   - Configure the trigger based on your requirements. For example, specify the URL for the HTTP trigger or the connection details for the FTP/SFTP server.

4. **Add Actions and Conditions**:
   - After the trigger, add actions and conditions to define the workflow. For example:
     - For processing orders, you might use actions like "Parse JSON" to extract order information and then use conditions and actions to route orders based on certain criteria.
     - For sending email notifications, add actions from the "Office 365 Outlook" connector to compose and send emails.
     - For moving files, add actions from the appropriate connector (e.g., "Azure Blob Storage") to copy or move files to Azure storage.

5. **Configure Connectors**:
   - Configure connectors by providing necessary credentials and permissions to access external systems and services. For example, configure Office 365, SFTP, FTP, or Azure Storage connectors.

6. **Test the Logic App**:
   - Test the Logic App to ensure that it works as expected. You can manually trigger the Logic App or simulate the trigger event to test the workflow.

7. **Deploy and Monitor**:
   - Once tested, deploy the Logic App and monitor its execution for any errors or issues. Azure provides monitoring and logging features to track the performance and execution of Logic Apps.

Example Use-cases:

- **Process and route orders across on-premises and cloud systems**: Use triggers like "When an HTTP request is received" or "When a new order is placed" and actions like "Parse JSON" and conditions to route orders based on certain criteria.

- **Send email notifications with Office 365 when events happen in various systems, apps, and services**: Use triggers like "When a new event occurs" and actions from the "Office 365 Outlook" connector to compose and send emails.

- **Move uploaded files from an SFTP or FTP server to Azure storage**: Use triggers like "When a file is added or modified" from the FTP or SFTP connector and actions from the "Azure Blob Storage" connector to copy or move files to Azure storage.

- **Monitor social media for a specific sentiment**: Use triggers like "When a new tweet is posted" and actions from connectors like "Twitter" or "Social Mention" to analyze the sentiment of tweets and take actions based on the sentiment.

Here's a basic JSON template for creating an Azure Logic App:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2016-06-01/Microsoft.Logic.json",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "logicAppName": {
      "type": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Name of the Logic App."
      }
    },
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Location for all resources."
      }
    }
  },
  "variables": {},
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Logic/workflows",
      "apiVersion": "2016-06-01",
      "name": "[parameters('logicAppName')]",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "properties": {
        "state": "Enabled",
        "definition": {
          "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Logic/schemas/2016-06-01/workflowdefinition.json#",
          "actions": {
            // Define actions here
          },
          "triggers": {
            // Define triggers here
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {}
}
```

You'll need to replace `"Name of the Logic App"` with the desired name for your Logic App and configure triggers and actions inside the `"definition"` property. You can add triggers and actions based on your specific use case.
