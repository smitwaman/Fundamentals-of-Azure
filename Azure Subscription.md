Here's an explanation of the components within a JSON file template used to retrieve a list of subscriptions linked to an Azure account:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions",
      "apiVersion": "2020-01-01",
      "name": "subscriptionsList",
      "properties": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

- `$schema`: This defines the URI of the JSON schema used for the template. It specifies the version of the schema used to author the template.

- `contentVersion`: Indicates the version of the template.

- `resources`: An array containing resource definitions. In this case, it defines a subscription resource.

- `type`: Specifies the resource provider namespace and resource type. For subscriptions, it's "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions".

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the API version to use for the resource.

- `name`: Specifies the name of the subscription resource. This can be any unique name you choose to identify this resource within the template.

- `properties`: Additional properties of the subscription resource. In this example, it's left empty, as retrieving the list of subscriptions does not require specific properties.

This JSON file can be used as part of an Azure deployment template to fetch a list of subscriptions linked to the Azure account associated with the credentials used for authentication. Once deployed, it would return information about the available subscriptions.
