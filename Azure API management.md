Azure API management 

●	Publish APIs for external, internal and partner developers



●	Provides statistics on developer engagement and other analytics required



●	Uses API keys to track and authenticate API calls

 





Creating and implementing an API management solution involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide along with JSON templates for each step:

**Step 1: Create an API Management Instance**

1. **Create an API Management instance in Azure:**
   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Click on "Create a resource" and search for "API Management".
   - Click on "API Management" and then click "Create".
   - Fill in the required information like name, subscription, resource group, location, organization name, and pricing tier.

**Step 2: Define APIs**

2. **Define APIs in API Management:**
   - Once the API Management instance is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal.
   - Under the "APIs" section, click on "Add a new API" to define your API.
   - Fill in details such as API name, URL, description, and other metadata.
   - Define operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each API endpoint.

**Step 3: Publish APIs**

3. **Publish APIs for external, internal, and partner developers:**
   - In API Management, navigate to the "Products" section.
   - Create products for each developer segment (external, internal, partner).
   - Add the APIs you defined in Step 2 to the corresponding products.
   - Configure access policies for each product to control access and usage limits.

**JSON Template for API Definition:**

```json
{
  "name": "Example API",
  "url": "https://api.example.com",
  "description": "Description of the API",
  "operations": [
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "urlTemplate": "/resource",
      "description": "Description of the GET operation"
    },
    {
      "method": "POST",
      "urlTemplate": "/resource",
      "description": "Description of the POST operation"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Track and Authenticate API Calls**

4. **Use API keys to track and authenticate API calls:**
   - In API Management, configure API key policies for each product.
   - Define how API keys are generated, distributed, and validated.
   - Enable logging and analytics to track API usage and engagement.
   - Use developer portals to allow developers to generate and manage their API keys.

**JSON Template for API Key Policy:**

```json
{
  "name": "apikey",
  "properties": {
    "displayName": "API Key",
    "value": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "type": "apiKey",
    "usage": {
      "callLimit": 1000,
      "interval": "1h"
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 5: Monitor and Analyze Developer Engagement**

5. **Provides statistics on developer engagement and other analytics required:**
   - Utilize built-in analytics and reporting features in API Management.
   - Monitor API usage, traffic patterns, error rates, and developer engagement.
   - Customize dashboards and reports to track KPIs and metrics specific to your API program.

By following these steps and utilizing the JSON templates provided, you can create and implement a comprehensive API management solution in Azure, catering to external, internal, and partner developers while effectively tracking and analyzing API usage and engagement.
