 Azure IoT

●	Internet of Things : The network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and interact with their internal states or external environment

●	This includes health equipment,environmental sensors,smart appliances etc.

●	Protocol Gateway bridges the traffic using AMQP 1.0 protocol.
●	Protocol gateway can be deployed using Azure Service Fabric,Azure Cloud Services worker roles or Windows Virtual Machines, or can be deployed on-premises.



Sure, I'll guide you through the step-by-step creation of an Azure IoT resource:

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**:
   - Go to https://portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account.

2. **Create a new IoT Hub**:
   - Click on "+ Create a resource" button in the upper-left corner of the Azure portal.
   - Search for "IoT Hub" in the search bar and select it from the results.
   - Click on the "Create" button to start creating a new IoT Hub.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - **Subscription**: Choose the Azure subscription you want to use.
     - **Resource group**: Either create a new resource group or use an existing one. A resource group is a logical container for grouping your Azure resources.
     - **Region**: Choose the region where you want your IoT Hub to be located.
     - **IoT Hub Name**: Enter a unique name for your IoT Hub. This will be used as the DNS name for your IoT Hub (e.g., my-iothub).
     - **Pricing and scale tier**: Choose the desired pricing tier based on your requirements.
   - Click on "Review + Create" and then "Create" to provision the IoT Hub. It may take a few minutes for the IoT Hub to be created.

3. **Access your IoT Hub**:
   - Once the IoT Hub is created, navigate to it by clicking on "Go to resource" from the deployment notification or by searching for the IoT Hub in the Azure portal.
   - Here you'll find various options for configuring and managing your IoT Hub.

4. **Register a device** (Optional, but recommended for testing purposes):
   - In the IoT Hub blade, navigate to "IoT devices" under the "Explorers" section.
   - Click on the "+ New" button to register a new device.
   - Enter a unique device ID and optionally set other properties like authentication type and status.
   - Click on "Save" to register the device.

5. **Configure IoT Hub settings** (Optional):
   - You can configure various settings for your IoT Hub such as endpoints, message routing, security, monitoring, etc., based on your specific requirements.

6. **Connect devices to your IoT Hub**:
   - Devices can connect to your IoT Hub using protocols like MQTT, AMQP, or HTTPS.
   - Use the connection string or device-specific credentials provided by the IoT Hub to connect your devices.

7. **Send and receive messages**:
   - Once devices are connected, they can send messages to the IoT Hub, which can then be processed, analyzed, and visualized using Azure services like Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Functions, Azure Storage, Power BI, etc.

By following these steps, you'll have successfully created an Azure IoT Hub and can start connecting and managing your IoT devices for various use cases like health equipment monitoring, environmental sensing, smart appliances control, and more.


Here's a basic JSON template for creating an Azure IoT Hub:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs",
      "apiVersion": "2021-07-01",
      "name": "[parameters('iotHubName')]",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "sku": {
        "name": "[parameters('skuName')]",
        "capacity": "[parameters('skuCapacity')]"
      },
      "properties": {
        "eventHubEndpoints": {
          "events": {
            "retentionTimeInDays": 1,
            "partitionCount": 2
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "parameters": {
    "iotHubName": {
      "type": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Name of the IoT Hub."
      }
    },
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Location for all resources."
      }
    },
    "skuName": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "S1",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Name of the pricing tier for the IoT Hub (e.g., S1, F1)."
      }
    },
    "skuCapacity": {
      "type": "int",
      "defaultValue": 1,
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Number of units in the specified pricing tier."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This template creates an Azure IoT Hub with the specified name, location, and SKU (pricing tier). You can adjust the parameters as needed based on your requirements.
