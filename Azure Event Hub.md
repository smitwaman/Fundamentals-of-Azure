Azure Event Hub



●	Big Data Streaming and Event Ingestion



●	Possible Use-cases



○	Anomaly Detection



○	Application Logging



○	Analytics pipelines



○	Live dashboarding



○	Archiving Data



○	Transaction Processing



○	User telemetry processing



○	Device Telemetry Streaming



●	Connects data source to listeners



●	Reading the data stream is done using Checkpointingwhere a pointer is placed on the stream and is shifted as the data is read. The location of the pointer is written into storage in case of a transient failure



●	Data is placed into the stream in partitions. Load balancing is performed automatically across partition.

here's a step-by-step guide to create an Azure Event Hub:

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**:
   - Go to https://portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account.

2. **Create a new Event Hubs Namespace**:
   - Click on "+ Create a resource" button in the upper-left corner of the Azure portal.
   - Search for "Event Hubs" in the search bar and select it from the results.
   - Click on the "Create" button to start creating a new Event Hubs Namespace.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - **Subscription**: Choose the Azure subscription you want to use.
     - **Resource group**: Either create a new resource group or use an existing one. A resource group is a logical container for grouping your Azure resources.
     - **Namespace name**: Enter a unique name for your Event Hubs Namespace.
     - **Location**: Choose the region where you want your Event Hubs Namespace to be located.
   - Click on "Review + Create" and then "Create" to provision the Event Hubs Namespace. It may take a few minutes for the Namespace to be created.

3. **Create an Event Hub**:
   - Once the Namespace is created, navigate to it by clicking on "Go to resource" from the deployment notification or by searching for the Namespace in the Azure portal.
   - In the Namespace blade, click on "Event Hubs" under the "Entities" section.
   - Click on the "+ Event Hub" button to create a new Event Hub.
   - Enter a unique name for your Event Hub and optionally configure other settings such as partition count, message retention period, etc.
   - Click on "Create" to create the Event Hub.

4. **Connect Data Sources to Event Hub**:
   - Once the Event Hub is created, you can start connecting data sources to it.
   - Producers (data sources) can publish events/messages to the Event Hub using Event Hubs SDKs or REST API.

5. **Create Event Hub Consumers (Listeners)**:
   - Consumers (listeners) can read data from the Event Hub and process it.
   - Consumers can use Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Functions, or custom applications to process the data.

6. **Implement Checkpointing**:
   - Reading the data stream using checkpointing is implemented in the consumer application.
   - Consumers can use checkpointing to keep track of their progress in processing events and resume from the last checkpointed position in case of failures.

7. **Data Placement and Load Balancing**:
   - Data is placed into the stream in partitions, and load balancing is automatically performed across partitions to evenly distribute the incoming event data.
   - Consumers can process events in parallel from different partitions to achieve high throughput.

By following these steps, you'll have successfully created an Azure Event Hub and connected data sources and listeners to it, enabling real-time streaming and event ingestion for various use cases like anomaly detection, application logging, analytics pipelines, live dashboarding, archiving data, transaction processing, user telemetry processing, and device telemetry streaming.

Here's a basic JSON template for creating an Azure Event Hub:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "namespaceName": {
      "type": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Name of the Event Hubs Namespace."
      }
    },
    "eventHubName": {
      "type": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Name of the Event Hub."
      }
    },
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Location for all resources."
      }
    },
    "partitionCount": {
      "type": "int",
      "defaultValue": 2,
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Number of partitions for the Event Hub."
      }
    },
    "messageRetentionInDays": {
      "type": "int",
      "defaultValue": 1,
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Number of days to retain events/messages in the Event Hub."
      }
    }
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/eventhubs",
      "apiVersion": "2017-04-01",
      "name": "[concat(parameters('namespaceName'), '/', parameters('eventHubName'))]",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "properties": {
        "messageRetentionInDays": "[parameters('messageRetentionInDays')]",
        "partitionCount": "[parameters('partitionCount')]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This template creates an Azure Event Hub within an Event Hubs Namespace. You'll need to specify parameters like `namespaceName`, `eventHubName`, `location`, `partitionCount`, and `messageRetentionInDays` based on your requirements.
