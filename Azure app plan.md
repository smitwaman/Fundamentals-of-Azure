Azure App Service Plan, Resource Groups.

●	An App Service Planis a set of compute resources that are required for an app to run.
●	Multiple apps can be hosted on the same app service plan.

●	An App Service Plan defines the following resource specifications

○	Region

○	Number of VM instances

○	Size of VM instances

○	Pricing tier

●	A Service Plan is defined inside a Resource Group.
 
Here's an example JSON file to illustrate the structure of an Azure App Service Plan and its association with a Resource Group:

```json
{
  "resourceGroup": {
    "name": "exampleResourceGroup",
    "location": "East US"
  },
  "appServicePlan": {
    "name": "exampleAppServicePlan",
    "resourceGroup": "exampleResourceGroup",
    "region": "East US",
    "vmInstances": 2,
    "vmSize": "Standard_D2_v2",
    "pricingTier": "Standard"
  },
  "apps": [
    {
      "name": "exampleApp1",
      "servicePlan": "exampleAppServicePlan"
    },
    {
      "name": "exampleApp2",
      "servicePlan": "exampleAppServicePlan"
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- The JSON file contains information about a Resource Group (`exampleResourceGroup`) and an associated App Service Plan (`exampleAppServicePlan`).
- The Resource Group specifies the name and location.
- The App Service Plan includes details such as name, region, number of VM instances, size of VM instances, and pricing tier. It is associated with the specified Resource Group.
- Two apps (`exampleApp1` and `exampleApp2`) are hosted on the same App Service Plan (`exampleAppServicePlan`).
