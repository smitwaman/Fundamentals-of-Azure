Azure Application Insights

●	Collects telemetry from on-premises and cloud environments

●	Application Insights: Application Performance Management platform for web developers

○	Monitor health of application

○	Continuous export of data

○	Push data into another application
 

Generate alerts

Here's a step-by-step implementation guide for Azure Application Insights with the mentioned functionalities:

1. **Create an Application Insights resource**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to "Create a resource" and search for "Application Insights".
   - Select the appropriate subscription, resource group, and region.
   - Provide a name for your Application Insights resource and click "Create".

2. **Instrument your application**:
   - Install the Application Insights SDK for your preferred development platform (e.g., .NET, Java, Node.js).
   - Retrieve the instrumentation key from the Azure portal and configure it in your application code.
   - Ensure that your application is sending telemetry data to the Application Insights resource.

3. **Monitor the health of your application**:
   - Navigate to your Application Insights resource in the Azure portal.
   - Explore the various monitoring tools such as Application Map, Performance, Failures, and Dependencies to monitor the health of your application.
   - Customize dashboards and add widgets to track specific metrics relevant to your application.

4. **Continuous export of data**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to your Application Insights resource.
   - Under the "Export" section, configure continuous export to export telemetry data to other Azure services like Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Monitor Logs.
   - Select the data types and specify the destination for continuous export.

5. **Push data into another application**:
   - Utilize Application Insights API to retrieve telemetry data programmatically.
   - Integrate with other applications or services by sending telemetry data to custom endpoints or third-party systems.
   - Implement custom data processing or forwarding logic to push telemetry data to the desired destination.

6. **Generate alerts**:
   - Navigate to the "Alerts" section in your Application Insights resource.
   - Create alert rules based on predefined metrics (e.g., availability, performance) or custom log queries.
   - Define the conditions that trigger the alert and configure the action group to specify the notification method (e.g., email, SMS, webhook).

By following these steps, you can effectively implement Azure Application Insights to collect telemetry data from on-premises and cloud environments, monitor the health of your application, continuously export data, push data into other applications, and generate alerts as needed.

Below is a basic JSON template to deploy an Azure Application Insights resource:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "applicationInsightsName": {
      "type": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Name of the Azure Application Insights resource"
      }
    },
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Location for the Azure Application Insights resource"
      }
    },
    "applicationType": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "web",
      "allowedValues": [
        "web",
        "other"
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Type of application the resource is used for"
      }
    }
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Insights/components",
      "apiVersion": "2020-02-02-preview",
      "name": "[parameters('applicationInsightsName')]",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "kind": "[parameters('applicationType')]",
      "properties": {}
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {
    "instrumentationKey": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "[reference(parameters('applicationInsightsName')).InstrumentationKey]",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Instrumentation Key for the Azure Application Insights resource"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This template creates an Azure Application Insights resource with configurable parameters such as name, location, and application type. You can customize it further based on your specific requirements, such as adding additional properties or configuring other settings for the Application Insights resource.
