In Azure, a resource group serves as a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. It acts as a logical grouping, allowing you to manage these resources as a single entity. 

Here's an explanation of the components within a JSON file used to define a resource group:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups",
      "apiVersion": "2019-10-01",
      "name": "myResourceGroup",
      "location": "eastus",
      "properties": {
        "tags": {
          "environment": "production"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `$schema`: This defines the URI of the JSON schema used for the template. It specifies the version of the schema used to author the template.

- `contentVersion`: Indicates the version of the template.

- `resources`: An array containing resource definitions. In this case, it defines a resource group.

- `type`: Specifies the resource provider namespace and resource type. For a resource group, it's "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups".

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the API version to use for the resource. 

- `name`: Specifies the name of the resource group.

- `location`: Specifies the Azure region where the resource group will be located.

- `properties`: Additional properties of the resource group. In this example, it includes tags, which are key-value pairs used for organizing and managing resources.

This JSON file can be used to deploy a resource group with specific configurations, such as name, location, and tags, as part of an Azure deployment template.
