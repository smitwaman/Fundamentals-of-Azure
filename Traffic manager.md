Traffic Manager

●	Services provided by Traffic manager

○	Handle service fail-overs

○	Direct traffic to endpoint with lowest latency

○	Direct traffic to alternative endpoints during maintainance or downtime

●	Traffic manager supports non-Azure endpoints hosted on-premises or hybrid cloud scenarios.

●	The following routing methods can be used

○	Priority: Can select a primary and secondary/backup endpoints

○	Weighted: Assign weights to endpoints, with a higher weight having a higher priority

○	Performance: Will automatically select closest endpoint with lowest latency

○	Geographic: Direct users to different endpoints based to location

○	Multivalue: To be used when only IPv4/v6 addresses can be used as endpoints

○	Subnet: A set of IP addresses can be mapped to a single endpoint in a many-to-one fashion

    },
    "Weighted": {
      "Description": "Assign weights to endpoints, with a higher weight having a higher priority."
    },
    "Performance": {
      "Description": "Will automatically select closest endpoint with lowest latency."

    }
  }
}
```

Combine these steps into a single JSON template for a comprehensive explanation of Traffic Manager, its services, and routing methods.
