Table Storage



●	Partition key: This uniquely identifies the partition where a particular record is stored



●	Row key: This is the primary key for a stored record



●	Partition key+Row key is used to uniquely identify an entity and is recommended to queries



●	Querying an entity using other fields results in reduced performance, especially with increased number of partitions





Here's a step-by-step explanation with a JSON template for Table Storage:

1. Define Table Storage:

```json
{
  "Table_Storage": {
    "Description": "This is a NoSQL based storage system.",
    "Features": [
      "Storage of high volume structured data",
      "Storing datasets without complex joins and foreign keys",
      "Querying data with clustered indices",
      "Accessing data using the OData protocol and LINQ queries"
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Define Partition Key:

```json
{
  "Partition_Key": {
    "Description": "This uniquely identifies the partition where a particular record is stored."
  }
}
```

3. Define Row Key:

```json
{
  "Row_Key": {
    "Description": "This is the primary key for a stored record."
  }
}
```

4. Explain the usage of Partition Key + Row Key:

```json
{
  "Partition_Key_Row_Key": {
    "Description": "Partition key + Row key is used to uniquely identify an entity and is recommended for queries."
  }
}
```

5. Explain the performance impact of querying using other fields:

```json
{
  "Query_Performance": {
    "Description": "Querying an entity using other fields results in reduced performance, especially with increased number of partitions."
  }
}
```

Combine these steps into a single JSON template for a comprehensive explanation of Table Storage features, including Partition Key, Row Key, and their usage recommendations.
